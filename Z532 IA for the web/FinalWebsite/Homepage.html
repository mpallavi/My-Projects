<p>The IUScholarWorks Repository is a digital repository for disseminating and preserving scholarly work created at Indiana University. It manages and distributes digital items and allows for the creation, indexing, and searching of the files and associated metadata to loc ate and retrieve the items. The IUScholarWorks Repository is built on DSpace, open-source software created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is widely used to create interoperable scholarship repositories. The IUScholarWorks Repository is supported by the IU Libraries and the Digital Library Program.</p>
<p>The IUScholarWorks Repository is organized into communities (departments, research centers, or other groups) and collections (published scholarly articles, conference proceedings, occasional papers, or other types of scholarly materials that a community decides to depos it here).</p>
