<h3>What is the IU Bloomington Data Management Service?</h3>
<p>Indiana University provides private and Open Access cloud storage and preservation solutions for IU-affiliated researchers, free of charge. Alternatively, consultations with our team can help researchers find the right third-party data storage, preservation, and access solutions to meet their needs. We also offer workshops and one-on-one consultations on how to meet Data Management Plan requirements set forth by grant funding agencies such as the NSF and NEH. IU researchers can use the DMPTool (Data Management Plan Tool) to help in the generation of such plans. Consultations may be made with iuswdata@indiana.edu regarding data management plans.
<h3>Who manages this service?</h3>
<p>Indiana University Bloomington's Data Management Service is a joint partnership between the Indiana University Libraries, UITS, Office of the Vice Provost for Research, and the Data to Insight Center. As experts on research preservation and access, the IU Libraries manage this service on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h3>How does the IU cloud storage and preservation platform work?</h3>
<p>The Libraries and UITS have partnered to leverage existing technologies (the IUScholarWorks repository, the Scholarly Data Archive (SDA), and the Research File System (RFS)) in order to provide a flexible, free data storage platform for researchers—especially those searching for solutions to comply with funding agency Data Plan mandates.</p>
<ul>
<li>For in-progress research, researchers may use the RFS for short-term storage of data, using the SDA as a backup mechanism.</li>
<li>For completed, "fixed" research, researchers may store their data privately in their personal SDA accounts and manage access in the traditional way: transferring files to those who request them, on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>For those who wish to make their fixed data searchable or openly accessible, researchers can upload it to the IUScholarWorks repository, where the data can be described, stored, and made discoverable by others. Researchers may assign an embargo to data in IUScholarWorks, keeping the data discoverable—but not accessible for download—for up to five years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What types of formats can I deposit?</h3>
<p>You can submit any format, including custom formats designed especially for your project. We provide migration services, as community standards change with time, for the most commonly used formats. Visit the DSpace [repository software] supported formats list to get a sense of how likely it is that the IU Bloomington Data Management Service will be able to maintain your data format in the future.</p>
