<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Eggplant Masala also called as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baingan_bharta">Baingan Bharta</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine">Indian Dish</a> made from eggplants cooked with onions, tomatoes, chillies, ginger, garlic and some Indian spices.
<strong>Baingan</strong> is what Indians call eggplant in hindi. And <strong>Bharta</strong> is the hindi word for roughly mashed/pureed vegetables.
<p>Honestly Eggplant Masala was my least favorite dish growing up. It was hardly made at home, and when made, I never ate it. I wanted to like it, because eggplants are good for you, but I just found it too slimy to look at.</p>
<p>Just before getting married to Mithun which was 2 years ago, I remember asking him about his all-time favorite dishes. I had no experience in cooking, and wanted to learn a few Indian dishes before I got married, since I knew the place Mithun stayed had no place to order Indian food from.  The only way to eat Indian was to make Indian.</p>
<p>And what better things to learn than my husband's favorite dishes!!</p>
<p>Mithun told me his all time favorite dishes were Dal Curry, and Eggplant Masala! As they say, opposites attract. These were two of my least favorite dishes. But, once married, I made them, and since I was not going to slog more in the kitchen and make something different for me, I also ate these dishes a lot and slowly, I started enjoying them.</p>
<nav id ="1"><h3>Ingredients</h3></nav>
<ul>
	<li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
	<li>1 tsp brown mustard seeds</li>
	<li>1 tsp cumin seed</li>
	<li>1 onion (sliced)</li>
	<li>eggplant (4 Japanese, long and thin, sliced 1/2 inch thick)</li>
	<li>1 serrano chile (seeded and chopped fine)</li>
	<li>1 tsp coriander</li>
	<li>14 ozs tomatoes with juice (canned diced)</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
</ul>
<nav id ="2"><h3>Steps</h3></nav>	
<ol>
	<li>Heat oil in a large frying pan until it shimmers. Add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds and heat about 30 seconds, until they pop.</li>
	<li> Add the sliced onions, and stir occasionally over medium high heat until they are deep brown in spots (this will take a while, but makes a big difference to the taste and they won't burn if you are careful).</li>
	<li> Add the eggplant and fry until the skin is turning brown and the flesh just starts to soften. You may have to add a little more oil.</li>
	<li> Add the chile, coriander, garam masala, tomatoes, and salt and pepper. Turn heat to medium low and cook until the eggplant is soft. Add a little water if it is getting too dry but it will be more solid than watery.</li>
	<li> Serve with white rice, spicy Indian lime pickle, and plain full-fat Greek yogurt (you only use a little yogurt and the low-fat yogurt tastes thin and sour).</li>
